# Node TDD Projects

This is a collection of Node projects and Katas built following Test-Driven Development (TDD).
Each problem will have its own feature branch (`f-<project-name>`).

## Number to LCD
### Part 1

This branch resolves [this Kata](https://learn.madetech.com/technology/katas/number-to-lcd/).

### Problem statement

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:

```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
| _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
```  
(each digit is 3 lines high)

### Part 2

Changing requirements [here](https://learn.madetech.com/technology/katas/number-to-lcd/part2.html).

Change your program to support variable width or height of the digits.
For example for width = 3 and height = 2 the digit 2 will be:

```
 ___
    |
    |
 ___
|
|
 ___
```
